###A business has approached your team and asked you to develop a website that advertises
their open positions. The website must showcase your coding and creative design skills. Your
website must include the following:
• A page including information about benefits and/or reasons to work at the company.
• A page including at least three different job openings at the company.
• An online job application form that allows applicants to apply for jobs at the company.
Note: Website does not have to be live. If partnering with an actual business, permission must
be received from the business to make the website public.
